# NBA Player Salary Machine Learning Project: Capstone

This project was the final project of my WGU degree. The purpose of the project was to develop a machine learning solution to solve a business problem. A formal proposal was written to describe the product and its implementation. 

The business problem I attempted to solve was how to better optimize a NBA team's cap space. The application aimed to solve this issue by using machine learning to determine a player's monetary value based on their given stats for a year. 

The development of the project followed the SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess) methodolgy. The main source of data came from a Kaggle.com [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats?select=Advanced.csv).
